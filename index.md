# About

您好，我是鄭翔尹，今年畢業於元智大學資訊工程所博士班。在學期間，發表2篇IEEE國際期刊論文和3篇IEEE國際會議論文；並參與5個研究計畫和3個產學合作計畫。主要的研究方向是電腦視覺，和深度學習；並了解物件偵測，監督與非監督式學習，強化學習...等方面知識。

My name is Cheng Hsiang-Yin. I have passion in computer science. This passion carried me through my education at Yuan-Ze University. My Ph.D. studies have provided me with broad proficiency in the use of computer science engineering methods, techniques, and tools. Alongside this, I experienced computer programmer with academic experience that has published 2 IEEE journal articles, 3 conference articles, and participated in 5 research projects, 3 industry-university cooperation projects.

My research interests are in the broad area of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and image processing. Specifically, I have extensive experience in the following research areas: object recognition and detection, machine learning, deep learning, supervised and unsupervised learning, image super-resolution, and able to write the following specialties languages: Python, Matlab, C++, and Java.
