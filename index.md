# About

您好，我是鄭翔尹，今年畢業於元智大學資訊工程所博士班。在學期間，發表2篇IEEE國際期刊論文和3篇IEEE國際會議論文；並參與5個研究計畫和3個產學合作計畫。主要的研究方向是電腦視覺，和深度學習；並了解物件偵測，監督與非監督式學習，強化學習...等方面知識。

My name is Cheng Hsiang-Yin. I have passion in computer science. This passion carried me through my education at Yuan-Ze University. My Ph.D. studies have provided me with broad proficiency in the use of computer science engineering methods, techniques, and tools. Alongside this, I experienced computer programmer with academic experience that has published 2 IEEE journal articles, 3 conference articles, and participated in 5 research projects, 3 industry-university cooperation projects.

My research interests are in the broad area of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and image processing. Specifically, I have extensive experience in the following research areas: object recognition and detection, machine learning, deep learning, supervised and unsupervised learning, image super-resolution, and able to write the following specialties languages: Python, Matlab, C++, and Java.


## Skill

### Programming Languages
- Python (approx. 5+ years experience. Mainly used.)
- Matlab (approx. 3+ years experience.)
- C++ (approx. 1+ years experience.)
- Java (approx. 1+ years experience.)

### Deep Learning
- Familiar with deep learning frameworks like：TensorFlow、Keras、Scikit Learn.
- Familiar with deep learning techniques like：CNN、RNN、GAN、DQN、A2C、A3C.
- Experience with deep learning applications like：
  - Object Detection & Recognition
  - Object Localization
  - Object Classification
  - Semantic Segmentation ... and so on.

## Details
We contribute **Smoke100k** database, a large-scale smoke detection database, which has several appealing properties:

- **Smoke100k** consists of **100k** synthesized smoke image, smoke free image, smoke mask, and bounding box positions.

- There are **3** subsets of synthesized smoke images for simulation of different smoldering fires as follows:
  - _Smoke100k-L_: samples are synthesized by smoke masks selected from the **Low** level with twenty kinds of angles,
  - _Smoke100k-M_: samples are synthesized by smoke masks selected from the **Middle** level with eight kinds of angles,
  - _Smoke100k-H_: samples are synthesized by smoke masks selected from the **High** level with fifteen kinds of angles.

For more details of the dataset, please refer to the paper [Smoke 100k: A Database for Smoke Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9015309).
