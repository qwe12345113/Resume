# About

I am currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science at King’s College London, building upon my strong foundation in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision. I obtained my Ph.D. in Engineering from Yuan Ze University, Taiwan, in 2021.

Before returning to academia, I worked as a Senior Engineer at Retronix Technologies, Inc., where I developed AI-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) on the Renesas R-Car V3H SoC. My work focused on driver behavior detection, FaceID systems, and blind spot detection, integrating computer vision models into embedded environments.

I am passionate about applying machine learning and data analysis techniques to solve practical problems and uncover meaningful insights from complex data.
